I want you to build/update Sora – Gift Store for All, a premium, elegant, magical e-commerce web app using React and Firebase for database management. Follow these detailed specifications exactly:

1. General Requirements

The app must be unique, functional, and premium in look and feel.

Use React (with functional components & hooks), TailwindCSS for styling, and Firebase as the backend/database for products, user info, orders, and wishlist.

The site should be responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop with smooth transitions.

All pages, components, and structure should remain organized and clean.

2. Theme & Design

Primary colors: Golden (#FFD700), Burgundy (#AC1C1C), Cream (#F5EBDD), White (#FFFFFF).

Dark mode: Classic black background (#080808) with all text, cards, buttons, and components readable and consistent.

Typography:

Headings → Playfair Display (serif, premium look)

Body → Montserrat (clean sans-serif, readable)

Layout & UI:

Glassy card layouts for products and sections

Elegant spacing, modern margins, smooth rounded corners

Hover effects: glowing borders, subtle scale-up on cards/buttons

Animations & Effects:

Background sparkle/falling confetti animations must be present and functional in both light and dark modes

Use animations like float, shimmer, heartbeat, blink for premium feel

Smooth transitions for hover, scroll, and page navigation

3. Dark Mode Requirements

Implement full dark mode toggle.

Background: classic black (#080808).

Text, buttons, cards, and gradients must adjust for readability.

All animations, including sparkle/confetti, must display correctly in dark mode.

Golden accents should remain visible in dark mode.

4. Firebase Integration

Store all products, categories, users, and orders in Firebase Firestore.

Implement real-time updates for inventory and cart items.

Include user authentication with Firebase Auth (email/password & Google login).

Wishlist, cart, and order history should persist in Firebase.

Ensure security rules in Firebase for protected data access.

5. Features & Functionality

Home Page: Hero section with sparkling golden highlights, featured products carousel, background confetti animations.

Product Listing: Elegant cards with hover effects, quick view popup, add-to-cart button, and ratings.

6. Responsiveness & Accessibility

Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Text and interactive elements should have sufficient contrast in dark and light mode.

Buttons and clickable areas must be accessible (minimum 44px target size).

7. Premium & Magical Feel

Maintain celebration & magical vibe like FNP (premium gift store inspiration).

Smooth glowing hover effects on all interactive elements.

Subtle sparkle/falling confetti background animation for premium feel.

Elegant card shadows, smooth transitions, and polished spacing.

8. Deliverables

Fully functional React + Firebase web app with premium golden theme and dark mode.

All Firebase interactions working (auth, product CRUD, cart, wishlist, orders).

Responsive and polished UI/UX.

Preserve all animations from the previous project with sparkle/confetti effect in both modes.

Maintain premium typography: Playfair Display for headings, Montserrat for body.

Full light/dark theme support, no layout breaks, readability perfect in both modes.

Summary: Your task is to build/update Sora from 0 to 100, exactly like my previous beloved project in terms of theme, animations, and elegance, but as a functional React e-commerce app with Firebase backend. Preserve structure, functionality, and premium feel, with full dark mode support and all animations intact
